App can be accessed live here: 



This app is a music making software that allows the user to experiment and explore with music. They can create different beats using the three options that we have provided for them: synth, bass, and drums. When the users start using the app, they will see a black screen with a menu on top. The mouse will act as a flashlight, that will allow the user to explore different components of the page. As the user clicks different components of the page, they will start generating music. Once they gain experience, they can start creating more advanced beats. The music will be visualized differently depending on the music the user creates. The user can choose to save their music once they are done.

Technologies:
We created the frontend of this app using React. The music was created using midi library.(Describe the music component a bit more here.)
